We had just experienced the difficulties of organizing discussions on such a short deadline firsthand and ran into many issues related to not being able to find information related to a specific issue. For example, during the jam, we ran into issues with artists not being able to determine if features were fully implemented, developers not knowing if assets were finalized and ready to be added to the final build, and writers not being able to find if character sprites were updated. With these issues in mind, we set out to create an application that could help us resolve these issues.

After two weeks of testing, we ultimately found that Next.js with React offered us the most functionality while also being relatively simple to learn and well-documented. We also decided to create a backend using WebSockets that leverages a MongoDB database (previously a PostgreSQL database) for storing information and worked on connecting the two within the first two sprints to get a minimum viable product available for demonstration. Once that demo was completed with generatable Kanban cards and chatrooms, we then focused the subsequent development sprints on taking those Kanban essentials and designing the rest of the board’s functionality to tie it all together. During this process, we tested around with a couple packages related to drag-and-drop functionality within React and eventually decided to use react-dnd for the flexible drag and drop behaviors and events it provided.

This was a problem because when updating state information in React, the whole component will re-render. As a result, we would often lose our WebSocket connection, as the re-render would attempt to recreate a new WebSocket on top of the existing one. This caused issues with data duplication and loss, so we had to use a combination of React states, refs, and effects to properly manage the re-renders. We found that states always forced a render, refs never re-render, and effects conditionally re-render when one of the dependencies updates, so we placed the WebSockets in a ref and the data in states, and then added the WebSocket listeners in an effect so that the functionality would adapt to changes in the application data. Once we had this properly configured, we could then pass states and refs between components, allowing data to be shared across the application.

To simplify the development process, we decided to look for a package to handle dragging instead, specifically using react-draggable, as it was the most used package for dragging. After experimenting with react-draggable, we found that it caused some issues with not properly updating the location of cards once dropped, so we went back to exploring for open-source packages to resolve the issue, this time searching for a solution that supported both dragging and dropping. Eventually we settled on using react-dnd, as it had built-in drag and drop listeners that fired events that we could easily use to send messages to reorder cards on the backend.

However, as we planned to add more features to the cards, it became more challenging to keep track of all the relevant pieces of information for that card. When we began implementing the checklist items on cards, we decided that it would be more effective to switch to a non-relational database so that we could allocate separate documents for each card with the column, tasks, and messages all stored in a single location. This minimized the number of queries necessary on the backend when rendering cards and chats and made it much easier to add new data to cards in the future.

One of the significant struggles was the integration of Firebase for real-time game interactions.

The duo spent countless hours researching best practices, experimenting with different data structures, and optimizing network code to reduce latency. Another challenge was designing the game's dynamic world. They wanted to ensure that each playthrough offered a unique experience, which required sophisticated logic for item and NPC placement. This task became a puzzle of its own, as they had to balance randomness with strategic placement to keep the game engaging yet fair. On the triumph side, mastering Firebase and seeing their game function flawlessly in real-time was a significant win. It not only boosted their confidence but also added a robust feature set that distinguished their game from many class projects. Additionally, the positive feedback from early testers on the game's engaging mechanics and aesthetic feel was a major win. It validated their design choices and hard work, motivating them to polish the game further. Overcoming these challenges taught Matt and Brian valuable lessons in persistence, technical problem-solving, and the importance of user feedback in game development. These experiences not only enhanced their technical prowess but also equipped them with a deeper understanding of what it takes to create a compelling and technically sound multiplayer game.
